# WELCOME IN MY CODEWARS-KATA-PROJECT REPOSITORY

The following repository contains katas, which are short snippets of code fragments that I use to develop and maintain my programming skills. All katas solved and stored in this repository come from `www.codewars.com` and mirror my `codewars` profile `mkamon`. The repository has been divided into the following subdirectories

1. cpp - directory with katas solved in c++
2. java - directory with katas solved in java
3. python - directory with katas solved in python
4. bash - directory with katas solved in bash
